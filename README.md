## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment:
- I built this app to learn REST API production.
- I worked with tasks on my personal to do list that i created.
## How to navigate on this project
All the APIs are managed with routes.
## Why I built the project this way
My plan is to become a Full Stack Developer eventually and so i had to learn how to create a custom server that responds to a REST Api i built.
## If I had more time i would change this
- Create more precise commits
- Create branches and use pull requests to generate a good workflow
- Use Trello to handle my tasks during development
- Improve on the UI
- Integrate more routes.
## Available Scripts
